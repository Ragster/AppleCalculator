## Description
A calculator tree made for my little 2.5 year old princesse. Based on an apple tree. Made as a universal app for iPhone and iPad

## Usage
* By choosing up to 10 apples on the left side of the tree
* Then choosing operand, plus, minus, multiply or divide
* Choosing up to 10 apples on the right side of the tree
* And finally touching equal

* Now the apples will start rolling into the tree, when all is in tree, the calculation begins and the result is showed on the sign on the ground, and the resulting apples will fall out of the tree and down in the basket :-)

* Now you can touch the Clear sign to clear and make a new calculation
